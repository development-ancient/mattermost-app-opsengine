This application allows you to integrate OpsGenie to your Mattermost instance, letting you know when a new alert is created, as well as getting notified about alert updates. Also, allows the user to create new alerts, add notes to alerts, close alerts, assign alerts, etc. without moving from the Mattermost window.

# Feature summary

**OpsGenie to Mattermost notifications:** Link your Mattermost channels with the OpsGenie Teams you want to see, so you and your team can get notifications about the creation and updates of each alert.

# Set up

## Installation

This plugin requires that your Mattermost workspace has the ``/apps install`` command enabled.

To install, as a super admin user, run the command ``/apps install http OPSGENIE_API_URL`` in any channel. The ``/genie`` command should be available after the configuration has been successfully installed.

The ``OPSGENIE_API_URL`` should be replaced with the URL where the OpsGenie API instance is running. Example: ``/apps install http https://mattermost-opsgenie-dev.ancient.mx/manifest.json``

## Configuration

1. First, install the app in your current Mattermost instance (refer to [Installation](#installation)) so that the ``/genie`` command is available.
2. Open your OpsGenie profile to get your credentials and link to your Mattermost instance.
3. Select the **Integrations** tab in the **Settings** menu. Then, click on the **Add Integration** button.
4. Inside the **Add Integration** menu, select the **API** option.
5. Update the integration name and access. Finish the **API** integration set up clicking the **Save Integration** button.
6. Copy the given API Key.
7. Return to Mattermost. 
8. As a super admin user, run the ``/genie configure`` command.
9. In the configuration modal, enter your API Key.

# Development

## Manual installation

*  Download the latest repository release.

### Run the local development environment

* You need to have installed at least node version 12 and maximum version 18. You can download the latest lts version of node for the required operating system here https://nodejs.org/es/download/

*  Install libraries: ``cd`` to the project directory and execute ``npm install`` to download all dependency libraries.

```
$ npm install
```

*  Update the environment configuration file. The ``.env`` file must be modified or added to set the environment variables, it must be in the root of the repository.

```
file: .env

PROJECT=mattermost-opsgenie-app
PORT=4002
HOST=https://mattermost-opsgenie-dev.ancient.mx
```

Variable definition

- PROJECT: In case of executing the project with Docker using the ``.build.sh`` file, this variable will be used for the name of the container
- PORT: Port number on which the OpsGenie integration is listening
- HOST: OpsGenie API usage URL

* Finally, the project must be executed.

```
$ npm run dev
```

### Run the local development environment with Docker

* You need to have Docker installed. You can find the necessary steps to install Docker for the following operating systems:

[Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
[Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/)
[Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/)

* Once you have Docker installed, the next step would be to run the ``./build.sh`` file to create the API container and expose it locally or on the server, depending on the case required.

```
$ ./build
```

When the container is created correctly, the API will be running at the url http://127.0.0.1:4002 in such a way that the installation can be carried out in Mattermost.
